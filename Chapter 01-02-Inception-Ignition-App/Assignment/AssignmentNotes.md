# Namaste React ðŸš€

# Chapter 1 and 2.

## 1. appendChild():

`appendChild()` is a method in JavaScript that is used to add a new child element to an existing parent element in the Document Object Model (DOM). It is commonly used to dynamically manipulate web pages by adding or inserting new content.

## 2. CDN:

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a distributed network of servers located in different geographical locations that work together to deliver internet content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other resources, to users in a faster and more efficient manner.

- Improved Performance
- Load Distribution
- Security
- Bandwidth Savings
- Scalability
- Improved User Experience

CDNs are an essential tool for modern web applications and websites, especially those that cater to a global audience or experience high traffic volumes. They help ensure a smooth and fast user experience, which is crucial for retaining and attracting visitors.

## 3. crossorigin:

The `crossorigin` attribute is used in HTML to specify how the browser should handle requests made to load external resources such as scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.

## 4. What is a React?

React is a JavaScript library to build user interfaces. It is written by Facebook developers and is an open-source library.

## 5. What do these 2 CDN links mean?

<!-- CDN Links React -->
<!--
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
-->

The first link means that this is the core of the React framework algorithm (`react.development.js`). The second link means that it is the React DOM, which is useful for DOM operations (Document Object Model).

## 6. HTML code snippet, the script tags are placed at the end of the body element rather than in the head element because

Of page load performance, allowing the rest of the HTML content to load before the scripts are executed. This means that the user can start seeing and interacting with the content of the page sooner even if the scripts are still loading or processing.

## 7. What is an Emmet?

Emmet is a plugin or toolkit that provides shortcuts and abbreviations for writing HTML, CSS, and other web-related code.

## 8. Difference between library and framework?

A library provides specific functions or features that you can use in your code, while a framework provides a more comprehensive structure. Libraries offer more flexibility, and frameworks are more opinionated.

## 9. Why is React known as React?

React, also known as React.js, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The name 'React' was chosen because the library is designed to be highly reactive to changes in program state.

## 10. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?

React is the core library for building user interfaces, while ReactDOM is the package responsible for rendering React components into the DOM. They work together to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

## 11. What is the difference between react-development.js and react-production.js via CDN files?

When using React via a CDN, you choose between `react-development.js` for development environments, which provides extra debugging tools and is larger in file size, and `react-production.js` for production environments, which is optimized for performance and has a smaller file size.

## 12. What is `NPM`?

`npm` is a node package manager. It is a package manager for JavaScript that allows developers to easily manage and share reusable code packages. `NPM` is a key tool in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## 13. What is `parcel/webpack`? Why do we need it?

Parcel and Webpack are both module bundlers for JavaScript applications. They help manage and bundle various pieces of code, including JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and other assets, into a format that can be easily served to a web browser. These bundlers help streamline the development process, improve performance, and ensure that the code is delivered to end-users in an efficient and optimized manner.

## 14. What is `.parcel-cache`?

The `.parcel-cache` directory is a folder created by the Parcel bundler. It is used to cache various files and data to improve build performance. `.parcel-cache` directories are specific to your project and can be safely deleted if you want to clear the cache. Parcel will recreate it as needed.

## 15. What is `npx`?

`npx` is a command-line utility that comes with npm (Node Package Manager). `npx` is a useful tool for executing packages from the command line, and it's commonly used in modern JavaScript development workflows.

## 16. What is the difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?

### dependencies:

These are the packages that your project depends on in order to run in a production environment. They include libraries and modules that your application needs to function as intended when it's deployed. When you deploy your project, only the dependencies will be installed, not the devDependencies. Examples of dependencies might include libraries for handling HTTP requests, database connections, user authentication, etc.

### devDependencies:

These are packages that are only needed for development and testing purposes. They are not required for the actual production deployment of your application. This category includes tools like testing frameworks, build tools, linters, and other development-specific utilities.

## 17. What is Tree shaking?

Tree shaking is a term commonly used in the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly in the context of module bundlers like Webpack or Parcel. It refers to the process of eliminating dead (unused) code from a bundle during the bundling or minification process.

## 18. What is Hot module replacement?

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a feature in modern web development that allows developers to update the code of a running application in real-time, without the need for a full page refresh. This means that you can see your changes instantly reflected in the browser as you make edits to your code.

## 19. What is .gitignore? what should we add and not add into it?

The .gitignore file is a configuration file used by the version control system Git. It specifies files and directories that should be ignored and not tracked by Git.
The purpose of the .gitignore file is to exclude files and directories that are not essential.

### What should we add:

- Generated Files
- Dependencies
- Environment-specific Files
- Logs and Temporary Files
- Compiled Code

### What should we not add:

- Source Code
- Configuration Files with No Sensitive Data
- Documentation and Readme Files
- Static Assets



## 20. What is the difference between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`?

`package.json` is a manually maintained file that describes the project and its dependencies in a more high-level manner, while `package-lock.json` is a machine-generated file that provides an exact, detailed record of the packages and their versions installed in the project, ensuring consistency across different environments. Both files work together to facilitate accurate and reproducible installations of dependencies.

## 21. Why should not I modify `package-lock.json`?

- **Reproducibility and Consistency:** The purpose of `package-lock.json` is to ensure that every member of a development team, or any machine where the project is being run, gets the same dependency tree. If you manually modify it, you're potentially introducing inconsistencies and making it difficult for others to reproduce the exact same environment.

- **Avoiding Version Conflicts:** `package-lock.json` contains detailed information about the specific versions of packages and their dependencies that were installed. This helps to avoid version conflicts that might arise if different developers install slightly different versions of packages.

- **Security and Stability:** It ensures that the exact versions of packages with known security patches and stability improvements are used. Manually changing versions could potentially introduce vulnerabilities or instability.

- **Preserving Developer Time:** Manually managing dependencies can be error-prone and time-consuming. Relying on the `package-lock.json` to manage these details allows developers to focus on writing code rather than worrying about dependency versions.

- **Automatic Updates and Resolutions:** When you run `npm install`, npm will use the information in the `package-lock.json` file to automatically install the exact versions specified. Manually modifying it could interfere with this automatic resolution process.

## 22. What is `node_modules`? is it a good idea to push that on git?

`node_modules` is a directory that contains all the dependencies (libraries and modules) required by a Node.js project. When you use a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager).

It's not a good idea. `node_modules` in version control is generally discouraged because it can lead to issues with repository size, performance, and reproducibility.

## 23. What is the `dist` folder?

The `dist` folder, short for "distribution," is a directory commonly used in software development projects to store the files that are ready for deployment or distribution to end-users.

## 24. Browserslist:

Browserslist is a tool and configuration file that allows you to specify which browsers your application should support. It is used in front-end development to define the range of browsers your project is expected to work in.

## 25. caret and tilda?

In the context of versioning in software development, the caret (^) and tilde (~) are special characters used to specify version ranges for dependencies in package.json files (used by package managers like npm).

- Use the caret (^) if you are willing to accept minor and patch updates but want to avoid breaking changes.
- Use the tilde (~) if you only want to accept patch updates and avoid any new features or breaking changes.
